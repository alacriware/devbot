# Adding devbot to your Server

## Inviting devbot

Before you get started, make sure you have devbot in your server. If you don't, you can add it using one of the two methods listed below:

### Using the Add to Server button on the bot's profile

If you have access to a server which devbot is already in, you can click on its profile and press add to server.

#### 1. Click on devbot's profile and press Add to Server

#### 3. Scroll down and press Authorize

### Using the invite link

Since Discord's bot discovery is not entirely rolled out, finding devbot in the first place might be troublesome. You can invite the devbot release stream of your choice using one of the links below:

Release: [https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=732280990323441704\&permissions=1633094593655\&scope=bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=732280990323441704\&permissions=1633094593655\&scope=bot)

Beta: [https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=941088206152147005\&permissions=1633094593655\&scope=bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=941088206152147005\&permissions=1633094593655\&scope=bot)

!!! note

    It's currently not reccomended to use devbot beta, as there is no stable hosting for it at this time.


Devbot should now be in your server, and you can move on to the more interesting part - using it!
