# Looking Ahead
As devbot is approaching 1 year of development, and as many changes in Discord's API have occured since its inception, it's time to take a look at devbot's position in the world of bots. Though being in version 2, devbot is still in early and unstable development, improving with every update. Since the introduction of slash commands, I've always had the plan to add slash command support, but have pushed it behind other plans. At this point, slash commands and interactions are a requirement for modern Discord apps. Finally, I will start a major refractor on the devbot codebase, again, this time with the goal of moving to interaction-based functionaliy. Version 3.0 will support slash commands only, and will have most existing commands. Major version 2 will cease development in pursuit of version 3.0.
